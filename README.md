# hackethglobalbuildquest
Hackathon ETHGlobal Build quest March 2022. 

Discord: procellulaire#4475


During this Hackathon we aim to publish and link together the different
components of the GAMEFI and Community sites https://aquametaverse.org 
https://aquametaverse.com https://watermetaverse.com

Our Metaverse virtual worlds feature Virtual Waterfront Properties.
3D models from fantasy, and real world Brands or individual designers 
of Paddle Boards, Surf Boards, Windsurf, Kite Surf, Air Wings, Foiling, 
Kayaks, Moto marine, Boats, Yachts. 

We are building Aquatic Sports Games and DEFI financial services that 
have a positive impact on communities and our planet. 
Our simulation and minigames are about Aquatic sports and Water activities 
where the recycling/reusing or cleaning out plastics debris rewards the
player with Cryptocurrencies.  

We help Brands, shops, local designers, and artists, to build, mint
and exhibit their NFT collections for the visitors to see and buy.

AQUA Metaverse features DEFI services, Virtual Waterfront Lands, 
3D Virtual Worlds, Minigames, OpenSea NFT Marketplaces, NFT creation templates 
for board designers, NFT waterfront property templates for communities to modify
and recreate their own looking-like piece of AQUA Metaverse and bridge in to the
blockchain economy.
